        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Falcon Heavy is currently the most powerful operational rocket in the world. Developed by SpaceX, it is designed to carry heavy payloads into space, including satellites, cargo, and even missions to the Moon and Mars. By utilizing three Falcon 9 first stages, it provides the lifting power needed for these ambitious missions.</p>
        <p>Unlike traditional rockets, Falcon Heavyâ€™s design allows for the full reusability of all three of its core stages. This capability enables more frequent launches and reduces the cost per launch, making it a game-changer for space exploration.</p>
